Bonjour ğŸ‘‹,Â I'm JÃ©rÃ©mie.

I turn ideas into code at RadioKing, sounds into songs as iZem, and cultural chaos into collaborations at Elis Records.

I geek out on all things Ableton, Javascript and Caetano Veloso ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·.

Originally from France, I managed to live in 6 countries and 15 cities without losing my headphones.
