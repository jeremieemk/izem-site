Mop Mop is an Italian drummer, producer, and DJ based in Berlin. This is the second remix Iâ€™ve produced for himâ€”the first one was released on vinyl back in 2013. Weâ€™ve crossed paths in Berlin a few times, most recently at an outdoor gig where Awesome Tapes From Africa, and Chief Boima were spinning. I hope I get to see Mop Mop live soon, and Iâ€™m excited to hear what heâ€™s cooking up next!
