Milton Gulli has been one of my favorite singers on the Lisbon scene long before I moved here in 2012. His work with the Afrobeat band **Cacique 97** had been on my radar for years, with tracks like _Chapa 97_ becoming staples in my DJ sets. Iâ€™ve always admired everything about himâ€”from the texture of his voice and his songwriting skills to his 70â€™s Jamaican and Nigerian influences.

Around the time I settled in Lisbon, Milton moved to Mozambique. There, he founded **Kongoloti Records**, a label dedicated to releasing music from Mozambique and Angola, among other projects. While I followed his adventures from afar, we began connecting through social media.

Milton occasionally returned to Lisbon to visit family and perform with **Cacique 97**. During one of those trips, we met up at my apartment in Alfama. He played guitar and improvised vocals over some of my beats. One of those beats was an instrumental I had created using stems from the **London Afrobeat Collective** track, _OlÃ©_. Inspired by its Fela Kuti-esque vibes, Milton improvised a couple of rap verses and sketched out ideas for a hook.

Building on those initial recordings, Milton completed the lyrics and refined the hook in his Mozambican studio, where he recorded the final vocals. The song was mixed by the talented **Jori Collignon** in his Palmela "Garage" studio and released on **Elis Records** on 27/01/2020.
