The story began in **Chelas**, a neighborhood in Lisbon, where my friend **LÃ©on Brichard** (Ill Considered, Wildflower, ex-Ibibio Sound Machine) had relocated. LÃ©on had brought his entire analog studio from London to his new home in Lisbon. I visited him a few times to write music together, and during one of those sessions, LÃ©on came up with a captivating riff on the double bass. The moment I heard it, I was hooked. I asked him to record the same phrase on other instruments, including the **Wurlitzer keyboard**.

That riff stuck with me, and I eventually sampled it for the live show I created to accompany the release of my *Hafa* album in 2016. We used it as the intro theme for the set, and it became a signature part of the performance.

Fast forward to a gig in London, where I was opening for **Afriquoi**. During the soundcheck, I heard **K.O.G.â€™s** voice for the first time. He was a guest performer, and his vocal talent blew me away. After the show, we chatted, and he mentioned enjoying the beats I played that night. I sent a few of those instrumentals to him via his manager, **Andre Marmot**, and K.O.G. recorded vocal ideas on them from his home in Sheffield, UK.

One idea stood out immediatelyâ€”his vocal take on LÃ©onâ€™s bass riff was irresistibly catchy. After some back-and-forth between Lisbon and Sheffield to perfect the vocals, the song felt almost complete. The final touch came from **Benoit Crauste**, a Parisian saxophonist and member of my live band. Benoit knew the groove inside out and improvised over the track until we found the perfect sax phrase for the bridge.

I shared the track with French producer **Guts**, who was starting a sub-label under **Heavenly Sweetness**. He fell in love with it, and I flew to Paris to finalize the mix with **Mr. Gib** at **One Two Pass It Studios**. The track was mastered that same week and released on vinyl via Gutsâ€™ imprint.

Just days after its release, the song was playlisted on **Radio Nova**, a French station that has been instrumental in shaping my musical influences.
