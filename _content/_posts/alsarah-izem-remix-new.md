I first discovered Alsarah (originally from Sudan) in 2013 through her collaborative album with DÃ©bruitâ€”one of my all-time favorite producers. I played it on loop, and it quickly became a template for my own projects. Since then, Iâ€™ve followed Alsarahâ€™s solo work and enjoyed both of her studio albums as well as her first remix album, which featured an impressive lineup of producers.

Nickodemusâ€”a brilliant producer in his own right and Alsarahâ€™s label bossâ€”invited me to remix a track for her new album. I drew inspiration from the Lisbon club scene I was immersed in at the time, aiming to infuse the mix with some of that Afro house/Batida flavor. I also made sure to leave ample space for the accordion, one of my favorite instruments. Listening back now, I sometimes wish the drums were punchier, but overall Iâ€™m happy with how the track turned out.
