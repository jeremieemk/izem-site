I always enjoy remixing afrobeat tracksâ€”itâ€™s such a rhythmically intricate genre. A couple of years ago, I reworked tracks by Fela Kuti and the London Afrobeat Collective, receiving great feedback from the DJ community. So when my Parisian friends Les FrÃ¨res Smith asked me to remix their upcoming single, I was more than happy to dive in.

The original track is rooted in Assiko, a popular dance rhythm from southern Cameroon. Right from my first listen, I could hear the strong musical elements that would make for a powerful dance track: energetic, catchy vocals and a banging horn section.

While working on the remix, I tested it out on several dancefloors and could instantly feel its impact on the crowd. I began sharing it with a few DJ friends, including the legendary Guts, with whom Iâ€™d collaborated on a couple of projects. Guts loved it and suggested releasing the track on a 12-inch vinyl alongside a remix I had done for his Philantropiques album.

The EP is now out on Pura Vida / Heavenly Sweetnessâ€”enjoy!
