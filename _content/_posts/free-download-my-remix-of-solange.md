Solange’s 2016 album has been a constant on my playlist for the past few years. Her line—“Drink it away / Dance it away / Work it away / Sexed it away / Read it away”—laid over a minimal groove still resonates with me. So when I heard a few raw stems of [“Cranes in the Sky”][https://songexploder.net/solange] in an episode of Song Exploder, I couldn’t resist sampling the acapella and synth harp for my live set. The crowd’s reaction was so strong that I knew I had to finish the remix and share it. It premiered on Gilles Peterson’s BBC radio show and drew enthusiastic feedback from around the globe. Now it’s out as a free download—enjoy and share!
