While living in Ireland, I ran a night called **Dublin Tropical**. These events featured DJs like **Mick T-Woc** and **Jeremy Murphy**, who would showcase their latest tropical crate-digging finds. One track that Jeremy played at every party was _Mistura de CarimbÃ³ Com Ciranda_ by **Pinduca**.

Years later, when Mick was visiting me in Lisbon, he came across another copy of the record in the suburbs at an old ladyâ€™s place. I digitized the track, extended it, and added some extra percussion. However, I didnâ€™t "warp" itâ€”I didnâ€™t force it to fit a beatgrid. Instead, I played the additional kick and percussion alongside the original record, keeping its natural tempo intact.

The edit was released to promote my DJ set at **Emile Omarâ€™s Tropical Discoteq** party and has since become a staple at many other events!
