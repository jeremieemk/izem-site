Sara Tavares was one of the Lisbon artists I admired long before moving to the city. BalancÃª was a staple on my personal playlist, and I often dreamed of collaborating with her. Her vocal and guitar style perfectly bridged American soul music and Afro-lusophone grooves. So, when Kalaf of Buraka Som Sistema reached out with an opportunity to work on additional production for her new single Coisas Bunitas, I was thrilled.

My first attempt at the project was rejected, but I didnâ€™t give up. A few months later, I met French-Caribbean pianist Karlos Rotsen, who had recently moved to Lisbon. I suggested we collaborate on a new arrangement for the song. Together, we blended Dâ€™Angelo-inspired keys with zouk-like drums to complement Saraâ€™s soulful vocal line. Pleased with the result, we sent it back to Sara via Kalaf. There was a long period of silence, but eventually, I got a call from Sara. She told me she wanted to include this version on her album and that we needed to finalize it within five days.

The following five days were spent in the studio, first with Karlos and later with Sara, who provided clear directions and valuable input. Working with her was an absolute delightâ€”she was funny, focused, and incredibly sharp. The version of Coisas Bunitas we created was included as a bonus track on her album.

PS : Sara Tavares recently passed away, leaving behind an incredible legacy that continues to inspire countless artists and fans. Her talent, warmth, and unique artistry will be deeply missed.
