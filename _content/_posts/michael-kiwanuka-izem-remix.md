I was completely hooked on Michael Kiwanuka‚Äôs debut EP in 2011, so I went to see him do a solo show at a pub in Islington, London. [Here‚Äôs some footage of that performance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZ_6SsX7Vg) Even then, his songwriting and stage presence were already so polished that everyone in the room knew he was going to make it big.

The track that really stuck with me was ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Get Along.‚Äù I came across a live recording where the acoustic guitar was buried in the mix, and I sampled bits of Mickael's voice to craft my own version. The remix ended up premiering on [OkayAfrica](http://www.okayafrica.com/african-music-michael-kiwanuka-ill-get-along-remix/).
