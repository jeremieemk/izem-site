Today I’m releasing a cover of the French pop song 'Chic Planète' that I recorded with a few friends. It was probably the first song I was obsessed with as a child. Summer 1987: FM radio, 7" singles, cassette decks — somewhere in the wet Breton countryside; 'Chic Planète' was the soundtrack of that summer.

Fast forward to 2024. The idea of covering this song had lived in my head for years; action only started when I mentioned it to my friend Bruno Patchworks, a fellow French producer based in Lyon. We talked about how underrated French pop is — how our culture often only remembers "high eyebrow" songwriters: smart, lyrical, sometimes pompous. I like those too, while also admiring the ones who craft great songs that stay fun, unpretentious and danceable.

The theme of this light, playful song feels even more relevant today than in 1987: an ode to planet Earth, a reminder it's what every living being shares. One of the best ways to honour its beauty, generosity and universality is simply to dance on it.

Alan Da Silva — Argentine-Brazilian, Barcelona-based — recorded the lead vocals. Deeply rooted in Brazilian music yet fluent in French (and occasionally writing in it), he was the perfect bridge between continents, giving the song a more global flavour.

Two more Barcelona musicians added their touch: Yasmeen N. Quintana Armendariz on backing vocals and Alê Ortega on trombone. Bruno and I programmed and recorded the remaining elements. Alan and I mixed the track.
