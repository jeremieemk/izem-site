In 2013, Ondatrópica and Soundway Records launched a remix competition, and I decided to give it a shot. I started by chopping Nidia Góngora's vocals and experimenting with rhythmic tricks to slow down the song’s BPM. To add texture, I incorporated a few sounds from live Ondatrópica recordings I had found on YouTube.

The remix ended up winning the competition, marking the beginning of a fruitful relationship with Soundway Records that eventually led to the release of my debut album. Not long after, I received a text from a friend who was at a party in Cali, Colombia. He told me that Quantic had opened his set with a 7" dubplate of my remix!
