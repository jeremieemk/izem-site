JosÃ© James was hosting a remix competition, and I decided to give it a shot. Thatâ€™s how I ended up with the stems for this track. I tried matching his vocals to one of my beats, but some of the melodies clashed with my instrumental. I ended up chopping out the parts that didnâ€™t fit, which gave it that unusual, stuttering vocal effect. Iâ€™m not sure whether JosÃ© ever liked itâ€”I never got any feedbackâ€”but Gilles Peterson did spin it on his BBC radio show. Later, I tried recording a different vocalist over the same instrumental, but it didnâ€™t really work. So if anyoneâ€™s interested in giving it a go, drop me a line!
