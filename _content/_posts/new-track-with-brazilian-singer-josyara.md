Working with **Josyara** was such a refreshing experience. Sheâ€™s an incredibly talented singer, guitarist, and composer. Based in SÃ£o Paulo, Josyara came to Lisbon last June for a few weeks. I first saw her perform an intimate gig at **Valsa bar**, and I was completely blown away by her artistry. I reached out to her afterward and proposed collaborating on a track together. She agreed, and just a couple of days laterâ€”on my birthdayâ€”we locked ourselves in the studio. This song is the result!

Hereâ€™s the official video of the song:

### Press Release:

"Hailing from Juazeiro in the State of Bahia, Brazil, Josyara is one of the most captivating voices of a new Brazilian generation. At 28 years old, she has already released two albums deeply rooted in the tradition of Brazilâ€™s greatest musicians (Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, Maria BethÃ¢nia, and Gilberto Gil) and the sounds of the sertÃ£o region. Constantly seeking new musical experiences, Josyara presents *Iara Correnteza*, a single with electronic accents, produced by French beatmaker iZem during the summer in Lisbon.

Iara is the name of her grandmother, but itâ€™s also the name of a divine, mythological figure: a mermaid whose unparalleled beauty enchants anyone who encounters her. In the song, Josyara finds herself captivated by this mythical voice from the depths of the rivers and embarks on an exploration of the magic powers of freshwater. This track is both an ode to nature and the Rio SÃ£o Francisco, two elements that have profoundly shaped the singerâ€™s life and perspective. Itâ€™s also a mystical reflection on life itself. The water symbolizes a quest for balance, an invitation to contemplation and indulgence, echoing the intricate paths within us.

*Iara Correnteza* represents a meeting point between the globe-trotting producer iZem and Brazilian folklore, bridging the gap between tradition and electro-acoustic aesthetics. This song also marks the launch of the French label **Elis Records**, based in Lisbon and co-founded by iZem, Arnaud DaniÃ©lou and Lekin, co-founder of the pioneering Parisian web radio **Le Mellotron**."
