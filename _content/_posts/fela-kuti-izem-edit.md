I was 19 when I first heard the fiery horns of Fela Kuti‚Äôs ‚ÄúLady‚Äù on my friend Nicolas‚Äôs speakers in my Paris neighborhood. Mesmerized, I rushed to the now-closed Virgin Megastore on the Champs-√âlys√©es in search of more music. I ended up with a Fela vinyl box set containing six albums, including ITT, and the guitar riff from that track has been stuck in my head ever since. This ITT remix was my contribution to celebrate Fela‚Äôs 75th birthday. Long live Fela!
