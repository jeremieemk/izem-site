Last year, I had the privilege of collaborating with one of Lisbonâ€™s most talented singer-songwriters, **Dino Dâ€™Santiago**. I first heard about Dino when I moved to Lisbon in 2012, through a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sh4FtOv6y0&ab_channel=DinoD%27Santiago) of him and **Sara Tavares** performing an acoustic version of _Nos TradiÃ§on_.

We eventually met a few years later through mutual friends and often crossed paths at the legendary **"Na Surra" Enchufada nights**. I followed his musical evolution and rise to fame as he collaborated with key figures of the _Nova Lisboa_ movement, including **Kalaf Epalanga**, **Branko**, **Paul 'Seiji'** from Bugz In The Attic, **Pedro**, and many other brilliant artists. I was even part of his live band for a while, playing shows alongside Dino, **Ellah Barbosa**, and **Ivo Costa** on drums.

During that time, Dino and I worked together in my home studio in Alfama, where we recorded his vocals over an instrumental I had created. **Ellah Barbosa** joined in to add the finishing touches, completing the song. It premiered on **Gilles Petersonâ€™s BBC radio show** and is now streaming on your favorite platformâ€”enjoy!
