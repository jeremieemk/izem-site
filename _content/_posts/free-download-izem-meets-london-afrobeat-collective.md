I first met the London Afrobeat Collective in 2010, when an Irish music festival commissioned Groovalizacion Radio—an internet radio station I co-founded in 2008—to produce a documentary on afrobeat. We interviewed some of the scene’s key players in London and stayed in touch with the Collective, catching their shows whenever possible. When they asked me to remix one of their tracks, I jumped at the chance. I added syncopated drums and vocal chops to craft a dancefloor banger—tested and approved by crowds around the world.
