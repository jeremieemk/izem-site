A few weeks ago, I embarked on a very special project. Cape Verdean singer Mayra Andrade reached out to me to help put together her new live show. Her 4th studio album was set for release in early 2019, with the tour kicking off in October 2018. Mayra wanted to perform the songs from the upcoming album live, even before its official release. Her expectations were high, as she hadn’t toured in over a year and a half, and she was eager to present an updated musical identity.

I had been following Mayra’s work for years. I programmed her music on the radios I worked for, included her songs in my DJ sets, and even tried remixing her track Tunuka a few years ago (though it didn’t go far). I’d often attempt to play her songs on the guitar in my bedroom. Just weeks before she contacted me, I saw her perform as part of Gilberto Gil’s live show in Lisbon. She stole the spotlight with her unique and powerful interpretation of Gilberto Gil’s music. Watching her interact with Gil on stage—a masterful performer in his own right—was a revelation. After that unforgettable concert, her name was on everyone’s lips in Lisbon.

The task she hired me for was clear: she needed help adapting her forthcoming album—produced by Romain Bilharz and 2B, combining electronically programmed beats and acoustic instruments—into a cohesive and engaging live show for a 4-piece band. This required sampling and capturing many electronic elements from the album and determining how to trigger or reproduce them live with instruments. I was also tasked with reimagining some of her older songs with a fresh electronic makeover and making the new material come alive on stage.

I was involved in the intense three-week rehearsal period, providing feedback to the band. Rehearsals were grueling, often lasting over 10 hours, with the goal of arranging and perfecting 15 songs—10 of which Mayra had never performed live before. Technically, we achieved the following setup: drummer Tiss Rodriguez triggered sequences using two Roland SPDs and a sensory percussion kit from Sunhouse; keyboardist Nicholas Vella reproduced synth textures on a Prophet 5 and a Kronos workstation; and bassist Swaeli Mbappé used a Moog Sub Phatty for the electronic basslines. Additionally, Mayra experimented with electronic vocal textures using an effects rig that included auto-tune, pitch shifters, filters, and reverb.

I attended the first few concerts of the tour, and all I can say is they are an incredible band. Mayra’s stage presence and ability to deeply connect with her audience are unparalleled. The feedback from the crowd was overwhelmingly positive as they heard some of their favorite songs (Tunuka, Lua, Ilha de Santiago) completely reimagined. This project was, without a doubt, the highlight of my musical year and one of the most exciting yet challenging endeavors I’ve ever been a part of.
