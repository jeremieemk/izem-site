I’m excited to share my remix of a Brazilian ’70s classic: Claudia’s “Deixa Eu Dizer.” The song boasts one of the catchiest samba-jazz hooks in history and was famously sampled by rapper Marcelo D2 and producer Nave for their 2008 hit “Desabafo.” I remember spinning this tune frequently in my sets when it first dropped, and its unforgettable chorus has been stuck in my head ever since.
