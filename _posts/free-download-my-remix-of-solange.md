Solange’s 2016 album has been on heavy rotation for the last couple of years. Those songs will forever remind me of the good and bad times of that period of my life. Solange’s words “Drink it away / Dance it away / Work it away / Sexed it away / Read it away” on that minimal groove still resonate deep. So when I heard some stems of “Cranes in the Sky” being broadcast in an episode of the Song Exploder podcast, I sampled the acapella bits and the synth harp to play them in my live set. The result got such a positive crowd reaction that it convinced me to finish this remix and share it with the world. The remix was premiered on Gilles Peterson’s BBC radio show and got some very positive reviews from all around the world. It is now available as a free download. Enjoy and share!
