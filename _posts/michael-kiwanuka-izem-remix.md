I was completely hooked on Michael Kiwanuka's debut EP (back in 2011) when I went to see him do a solo gig in a pub in Islington, in London (found some footageÂ [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhZ_6SsX7Vg)). His songwriting and performing skills were already super tight and everyone in the room could feel he was going to make it big. The one song that got stuck in my head at the time was "I'll get along". I found a live recording of the song somewhere in which the acoustic guitar was quite low in the mix. I used bits of that recording to recreate my own version of the song. This remix got premiered onÂ [OkayAfrica](http://www.okayafrica.com/african-music-michael-kiwanuka-ill-get-along-remix/).
