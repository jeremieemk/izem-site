I don't recall the exact tracklist of my first ever DJ set but I do remember two of the highlights of the night: Celia Cruz's "Dos Jueyes" and Elza Soares' "Mas Que Nada". I was 22 and we were at an international student residence in South Paris where my girlfriend at the time was residing. Since then, Elza Soares and this song occupy a very special place in my heart. Seeing her on stage during Recife Carnival back in 2008 only made this feeling bigger.

When I first heard her last album, the very successful "Mulher do Fim do Mundo,‚Äù it took me a while to enter its dark and bitter aesthetics. I was really impressed by the social impact some of those songs had in Brazil. "O Canal" wasn't an easy song to remix and instead of rewriting the rhythm and structure as I usually do, I chose to strip it down instead. I tried to remove some of the string and guitar layers to create space for the vocals and the rhythm. And I did all of this in a quite short timeframe, so I can now hear some things I wish I had time to do better, but hey.... Chill!
