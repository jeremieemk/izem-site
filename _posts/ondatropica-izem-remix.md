Ondatrópica and Soundway Records launched a remix competition back in 2013 and I thought I’d give it a try. I started by chopping Nidia Góngora's voice and looking for rhythmic tricks to lower the song's BPM. I also added a couple of sounds taken from some Ondatrópica live recordings I had found on youtube. The remix ended up winning the competition. This event started a fruitful relationship with Soundway Records, which led to the release of my debut album. Not long after this episode, I got a text from a friend who was at a party in Cali (Colombia) telling me that Quantic had opened his set with a 7" dubplate of my remix!
