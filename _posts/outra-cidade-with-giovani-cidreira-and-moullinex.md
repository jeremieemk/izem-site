Over the last 4 or 5 years, Lisbon became a very rich music hub. We had the chance to see many emerging Brazilian musicians transiting through the Portuguese capital. We saw many of them playing small improvised gigs in places like Valsa, Banco, Anjos70... Those artists would generally use Lisbon as a base to play gigs in other parts of Europe. This is how I met with singer-songwriter Josyara.

Only a few weeks after meeting her, another mind-blowing artist from Bahia, Brazil got in touch. Giovani Cidreira and his partner Gathaa were in town and we agreed to get in the studio together. I called Portuguese producer Moullinex to join the party guessing he would love Giovani's music and personality.

Giovani suggested re-recording an older composition of his "Outra Cidade". He sent me an acapella version of the song via whatsapp and we were sold. We spent a short session recording vocals and some vintage synth grooves in Moullinex's studio in the multicultural neighborhood of Arroios, Lisbon. I edited the recording, reworked the beat, and headed back to Moullinex studio to add the last touches. The song was mixed by Jori Collignon in his Palmela studio and released to the world on the 2nd of April 2020.
