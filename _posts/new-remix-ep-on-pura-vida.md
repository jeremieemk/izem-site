I always have a lot of fun remixing afrobeat tracks. I gave Fela Kuti and London Afrobeat Collective a shot a couple of years ago and received very positive feedback from the DJ community. So when my Parisian friends of Les Fr√®res Smith got in touch to rework their upcoming single, I was happy to give it a try. The original song's rhythm is a popular dance from the South of Cameroon called "Assiko" . When I first heard it, I could spot straight away those strong musical elements I could rely on to build a solid dance track : catchy energetic vocals and a banging horn section.

I started testing the track on a number of dancefloors while still working on it. I could feel very clearly its impact on the crowd and started sharing it with a few DJ friends. Among them was the mighty Guts, whom I had worked with on a couple of projects. He offered to put the track on a 12" together with a remix I had done for him while working on his "Philantropiques" album. The EP is out now on Pura Vida / Heavenly Sweetness.
