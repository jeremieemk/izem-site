This month I’m sharing my own remixed version of a Brazilian 70's classic: Claudia's "Deixa Eu Dizer”. This song contains one of the most catchy samba jazz hooks of history and it was already sampled by rapper Marcelo D2 and producer Nave​ on their classic 2008 hit"Desabafo”. I remember playing this tune in my sets very often when it was released and this chorus stayed stuck in my mind.
