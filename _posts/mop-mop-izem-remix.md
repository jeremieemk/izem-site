Mop Mop is an Italian drummer, producer, and DJ who lives in Berlin. This is the second remix I produce for him. The first one was released on vinyl back in 2013. We met in person in Berlin a couple of times. The last time I was there, we were hanging at an outdoor gig where Awesome Tapes From Africa, Nomad, and Chief Boima were playing tunes. Amazing vibes. I hope to see Mop Mop live soon and I'm really looking forward to hearing what he is cooking next!
