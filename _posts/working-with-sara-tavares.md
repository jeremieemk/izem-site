Sara Tavares is one of the Lisbon artists I had been following way before moving here. "Balancê" was one of my shower hits and I dreamt of collaborating with her for quite some time. Her vocal and guitar style is the perfect crossover between American soul music and Afro-lusophone grooves. So when Kalaf of Buraka Som Sistema got in touch to offer me to work on some additional production for her new single "Coisas Bunitas", I was thrilled.

My first try was rejected but I didn't give up. I met French-Caribbean pianist Karlos Rotsen (who had just moved to Lisbon) a few months later and suggested we try and write a new arrangement for this song together. We tried to blend d'Angelo-esque keys with zouk-like drums to support her soulful vocal line. We were happy about the result so we sent it back to Sara via Kalaf. We didn't get much feedback for a while but a few months later I got a phone call from Sara saying she wanted to include this version in her album and that we had to complete it within the next 5 days.

We spent the following 5 days in the studio, first with Karlos then with Sara, who gave us directions and provided some input. Working with her was a delight! She is funny, clear-minded, and very focused. This version of "Coisas Bunitas" was included as a bonus track on the album.
