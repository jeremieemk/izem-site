Enchufada Records is the brainchild of the founders of Lisbon's mythical band Buraka Som Sistema. The label started during the "blog-era", the late 2000's, when music fans turned to blogs for discovering new sounds and record stores disappeared. This era gave visibility to "peripheral" music scenes, pockets of creativity located outside the traditional centres of the music industry. Amongst those influential scenes and rhythms were Rio De Janeiro's "Baile Funk", Buenos Aires' "Electronic Cumbia" and Luanda's "Kuduro".

Enchufada became a hub for those subcultures and Buraka Som Sistema turned into a very successful act. This is cultural soil also gave rise to MIA and Diplo, around the same time.

I started deejaying and producing when these scenes were emerging. This era of music and those subcultures informed heavily my DJ sets and my vision of music. The influence of Enchufada only grew when I moved to Lisbon, in 2012.

In 2016, the Enchufada guys invited me to play at their monthly "Hard Ass Session" in Lux (Lisbon) and Maus Habitos (Porto). I performed at a few more events of the label in Lisbon and Porto since. The connection also led to Enchufada releasing some of my own music on the label. I put together an EP for them, finishing a few percussive beats I had been working on for a few years. My favourite one and the oldest of the entire EP is "Major Stef", made of many jazz drumming samples. I am also very proud of "Shebeen Chic", which contains a sample of Daniel Haksmaan's "Who's afraid of Rio", another reference to the golden days of the blog era!
