I got the stems of this song through a remix competition José James was running. I tried to edit his vocals on a beat of mine but parts of the melody weren't fitting harmonically with my instrumental. So I just removed the parts of his vocals where the notes wouldn't fit in. That's where this weird chopped effect comes from. I'm not sure José liked it, I never had any feedback from him but Gilles Peterson played it on his BBC radio show. Later I tried to record some other vocalist on this instrumental but it didn't really work so it's still up for grabs... Just drop me a line!
