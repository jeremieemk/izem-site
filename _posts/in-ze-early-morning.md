Today is the day! My new album "in Ze early morning" is out on Elis Records
Five years in the making, dozens of vocalists, musicians and collaborators... A long chapter of my life!
It was recorded and produced between Portugal, Brazil, France, Colombia, Mozambique and the UK.

"Returning from a journey around the world, iZem has literally rediscovered himself through the creation of this album. He has found a balance between the influences of his travels, his experiences, and his identity as a French artist. "in Ze early morning" marks a new era in his career and personal evolution, an important step for an artist always in full effervescence and exploration. Among the nine tracks of the album, we discover remarkable collaborations with international artists: the Brazilians Flavia Coelho and Lucas Santtana, the Cape Verdean Dino D'Santiago, and the Colombian Jimena Angel. These meetings are not the result of chance; all share a passion for musical diversity and the creation of bridges between genres and cultures. Together, they create a unique experience that allows the appreciation of new sounds. We thus discover the husky and charismatic voice of Flavia Coelho in an original rap little explored by the singer until now (Sua Pele), while Lucas Santtana lays down an engaged text on a laid-back reggae title with oriental flavors (Maria Antonieta). Dino D'Santiago distills his moving voice and sensitivity on a rhythm of baile funk revisited with ethio-jazz sauce (LÃªba), when Jimena Angel lays a hypnotic and enchanting voice on a surprisingly soft title, sung in duet with iZem himself (A Veces).

"in Ze early morning" is a fusion of musical aesthetics, the fruit of the artist's passionate quest to reveal links between cultures. iZem is constantly composing on the move, creating songs from loops and ideas initiated on the road, with his laptop as a companion. These initial seeds are then developed with musicians from around the world, to create innovative pieces between tropical trip-hop, Afro-Latin music, and avant-garde electro beats.

Recorded on the road, between Lisbon, Paris, and Brazil, and then finalized at the Vox studio in Montpellier, this project was composed with a brass section influenced by Afro-Latin and ethio-jazz that performs meticulous arrangements signed Daniel Moreau from the group Etioda, who also sprinkles Rhodes phrases adding a jazz flavor to the project. By thus enriching his discographic production, iZem affirms his place as an artist and electronic music producer who counts in the landscape.
