Last year I had the chance to collaborate with one of Lisboa’s most talented singer-songwriters, Dino D'Santiago. Dino is one of the first artists I heard about when moving to Lisbon back in 2012. I discovered him through a video of him and Sara Tavares singing an acoustic version ‘Nos tradiçon’.

⁣We met in person a few years after through friends in common. We often bumped into each other during those mythical "Na Surra" Enchufada nights. I followed his musical development and rise to fame through his teaming up with Kalaf Epalanga, Branko, Paul ’Seiji’ of Bugz In The Attic, Pedro, and other brilliant protagonists of the ’Nova Lisboa’. ⁣⁣⁣ I was part of his live team for a while and played a few shows with him, Ellah Barbosa, and Ivo Costa on drums.

⁣During that period, we sat together in my home studio in Alfama to record his vocals on an instrumental of mine. Ellah Barbosa also got involved and put the last touch to this song. The song was premiered on Gilles Peterson's BBC radio show and is now streaming on your favourite platform.
