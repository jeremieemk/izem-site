I met the guys of the London Afrobeat Collective back in 2010 when we (as part of Groovalizacion Radio) were commissioned by an Irish music festival to produce a radio documentary on afrobeat. We did a series of interviews in London with some of the current afrobeat activists. I stayed in touch with these guys and went to see them perform whenever I was in London. So when they offered me to remix their music I thought I'd give it a shot. I brought some syncopated drums and vocal chopping in the mix to put together this dancefloor banger. Tested and approved by many crowd movers around the world!
