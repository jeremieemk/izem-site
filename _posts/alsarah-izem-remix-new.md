I first heard Alsarah (originally from Sudan) on the album she did with Débruit, one of my all-time favourite producers. I remember thinking how lucky Débruit was to collaborate with this incredibly skilled singer. I kept following Alsarah's work and enjoyed a lot both studio albums as well as her first remix album project and its impressive producer roster. I first remixed a Nickodemus track that featured Alsarah back in 2016. Shortly after, Nickodemus - also her label boss - asked me to work on a track of the new remix album. And here it is!
