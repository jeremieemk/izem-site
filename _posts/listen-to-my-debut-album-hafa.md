I first released this album back in June 2015. The album was really well received by DJ's and radio stations. It was the album of the week on WDR Funkhaus Europa (Germany) and got some airplay on Radio Nova (France) and BBC Radio 6. Both Mount Kimbie and Bonobo played the opening tune "Sadeo" on their NTS radio show. After a few months, Soundway Records got in touch to release the album. They printed it on vinyl (a few copies left here!) and re-released it in October 2016. Around the same period I put together a band to play a launch tour. The band was composed of Binisa Bonner (bass + vocals), Benoit Crauste (saxophone), Kino Sousa (ableton controls) and myself on guitar. More about the songs of the album here:

**Sadeo**: “This is a song I wrote with Fehdah, an Irish singer born in Sierra Leone. She evokes memories of her childhood in Africa. She sings in a language that blends Sierra Leonan Mende, English and her own imagined words.”

**Water**: “The importance of water for humanity is the center theme of this song co-written by Dublin-based Nigerian drummer Segun Akano. Everything including drums was recorded in my then bedroom in Dublin."

**Quiver**: “This song was part of my first EP, released in 2011. It evokes sensuality, love and intimacy. Malaysian Irish singer Aminah Dastan grew up on soul music, folk and dub between New Zealand, Malaysia and Dublin, where this song was recorded.”

**L'Horloge**: “Originally written for a live performance, the song went through the hands of Irish saxophonist Paul Harris to become this track swaying between jazz, afrobeat and house music.”

**Água Viva**: “The story behind this song started in 2013 when Brazilian DJ and crate-digger Tahira visited me in Lisbon. He gave me a copy of the album "Krishnanda" by Pedro Santos (aka Pedro Sorongo), a long-forgotten 1960s gem that includes the song “Água Viva”, an ode to the beauty and harmony of nature. I have been obsessed with this song since and asked the British-Brazilian singer Nina Miranda (ex-Smoke City) to record a cover. The recording took place in Nina's attic in North London.”

**Kulala**: “This is another cover. First performed by South African singer Dorothy Masuka, it was made popular by Miriam Makeba. It is one of my DJ classics, and also a favourite of Binisa Bonner, Congolese-English singer. I saw her perform this song on stage in London in 2010. We became friends around that time and recorded this cover in 2014. Binisa was also part the album release tour in 2016.”

**Seasons**: “This song is the result of one of the jam sessions we used to play at Aminah Dastan’s house in Crumlin, Dublin. This song owes a lot to the wonderful horn arrangement by saxophonist Paul Harris.”

**Wind, Sand and Stars**: “The title refers to the Saint-Exupéry book. The music evokes serenity and chaos, loneliness and crowds, sun and storms. Recorded with Brazilian duo Eko, this track closes the album as a forced landing in the middle of the desert or an escape to a remote island of the Atlantic.”
