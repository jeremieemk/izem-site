The story started in an estate in Chelas, a neighbourhood in Lisbon. My friend Léon Brichard (Ill Considered, Wildflower, Ex-Ibibio Sound Machine) was based in an apartment in this area. He brought his whole analog studio from London to his new home in the Portuguese capital. I went there a few times to write some music with him. During one of those sessions, Léon came up with that catchy riff on the double bass. It clicked for me straight away so I asked him to record the same phrase on other instruments, including on the Wurlitzer keyboard. I kept this idea in my computer and used this riff as a sample during the live show I put together when I released my “Hafa” album, back in 2016. We were playing it as the intro theme of the set.

One day I was opening for Afriquoi in London and heard K.O.G’s voice during soundcheck. He was doing a guest appearance and his vocal talent struck me. We had a chat after the gig . He told me he enjoyed the beats I played in my live show on that same night. I sent him a few of those instrumentals via his manager, Andre Marmot. He recorded his vocal ideas on my beats from his hometown of Sheffield (UK). The most striking bit was the one he recorded on my friend Léon's bass riff. It was catchy as hell.

After sending demos back and forth between Lisbon and Sheffield to get the vocal take right, the song felt almost complete. Benoit Crauste, a Parisian sax player who travels to Lisbon, added the last touch of magic. He had been part of my live band so he knew the underlying beat very well. He improvised on it for a while and I kept the sax phrase I needed for the bridge. I sent this tune to the French producer Guts, who was starting a sub-label of Heavenly Sweetness. He fell in love with the song. I flew to Paris to get the track mixed by Mr Gib at One Two Pass It studios,. We mastered the song in the same week and put it out on vinyl via Guts' imprint. The song was playlisted on Radio Nova (French radio that contributed largely to forge my music culture) a few days after its release.
