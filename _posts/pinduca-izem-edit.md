When living in Ireland, I used to run a night called Dublin Tropical. Guys like Mick T-Woc and Jeremy Murphy would play their latest tropical crate-digging find during those events. One of the tunes Jeremy Murphy would play at every party was "Mistura de Carimb√≥ Com Ciranda" by Pinduca. Once, when Mick was staying at my place in Lisbon, he found another copy of the record in the suburbs at an old lady's place. I encoded the record, extended it, and added a bit of extra percussion. Technically I didn't "warp" it, meaning that I didn't try and make it fit on a beatgrid. I just played the extra kick and percussion along the record instead of forcing the record into a given bpm. It was released to promote my DJ set at Emile Omar's "Tropical Discoteq" party and has since been rinsed in many other parties!
