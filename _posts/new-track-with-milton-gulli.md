Milton Gulli is one of my favourite singers on the Lisbon scene since way before I moved here in 2012. The songs he released with his Afrobeat band "Cacique 97" had been on my radar for a number of years, "Chapa 97" being one of my DJ classics back then. I love everything from the texture of his voice, his songwriting skills to his 70's Jamaican and Nigerian influences.

Milton moved to Mozambique around the time I settled in Lisbon. He started a record label there, Kongoloti Records, releasing music from Mozambique and Angola amongst other projects. I was following his adventures from a distance and we started to know each other through social media.

Milton came back to Lisbon a few times to visit his family and play gigs with Cacique 97. On one of those occasions, we got together in my Alfama apartment. He played guitar and improvised vocals on top of some of my beats. One of those was an instrumental I constructed from stems of a London Afrobeat Collective song, "Ol√©". Milton was inspired by the Fela-esque vibes and improvised a couple of rap verses and some ideas for a hook.

Milton used those recordings as a basis to finish writing lyrics for the verses and polishing the hook. He recorded the final vocals in his Mozambican studio. The song was mixed by the lovely Jori Collignon in his Palmela "Garage" and first released on Elis Records on 27/01/2020.
