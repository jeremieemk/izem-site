I grew up listening to the French rap hits he produced in the '90s with his band "Alliance Ethnik". I later fell in love with his solo albums and his "Beach Digging" compilations without knowing the same person was behind those projects. Until one day he showed up in Lisbon and got in touch.

He had been listening to my debut album and offered to work together. We connected straight away on a human and musical level, carrying both the hip-hop-nerd-meets-globe-trotter genes.

The first project we worked on together was a single by K.O.G and myself, which he released on his own label, Pura Vida. We mixed the song together with MrGib at OneTwoPassIt studios in Paris. I learned from him how important this stage of the process is. Working within a traditional studio framework versus my DIY laptop-producer background was a big eye-opener.

Our collaboration developed into me collaborating on his 2019 "Philantropiques" album. Guts wrote me a few months before the recording to show me some ideas. An idea that caught my attention was recording a cover of 1974's Vum Vum "Mucagiami". He asked me if I knew an Angolan singer in Lisbon we could work with to record this cover.

While researching potential candidates to sing that song, I discovered that Vum Vum was alive and based in Lisbon. I managed to get in touch through a couple of friends and we met one sunny morning on Martim Moniz Square.

After a few backs and forth between Franck (Heavenly Sweetness), Guts and Vum Vum, he accepted to re-record the song for Guts' album. Guts and his team (including Paris-based Brazilian Angolan musician Lameck, Cyril Atef, and Ben Arbanell Wolff) recorded a first version of the instrumental, referencing the original song's framework, the Angolan "Semba" rhythm.

I recorded Vum Vum's vocals at Pimenta Preta studios in Lisbon on top of that instrumental. Vum Vum, 74 years old, was highly excited about the whole recording process. He gave a mind-blowing performance and showed a lot of enthusiasm for the demo backing track he was recording on.

The last episode of this production process happened in OneTwoPassIt studios in Paris. Guts had gathered an impressive line-up of musicians for his album. I went and join the crew in Paris for a few days. During those days we reworked the "Mucagiami" instrumental together with Lameck and the other musicians involved. During those sessions, I also got involved in co-producing "Ja Nao Ha Mais Paz" and "Nosso Carimbo é do Mundo" from the same project.

Another moonshot idea Guts had for this album was to record Brazilian Carimbo legend, Pinduca. Pinduca is in his 80's and lives in Belém, North of Brazil. We had been lucky with Vum Vum so I said I would give the Pinduca idea a try. I did manage to get in touch with one of his sons (or grandsons...) and the response was incredibly enthusiastic. Pinduca and his team wrote the vocal line of the song, recorded some extra instruments on top of what we had recorded in Paris, shot a video in the studio, and shipped everything in a whizz. Guts recorded France-based Brazilian singer Nazare Pereira on the same song.

"Philantropiques" was mixed and mastered quickly after those sessions and was released on March 29, 2019. It was an amazing experience of teamwork and an eye-opener on Guts' talent to navigate so many musicians, influences, locations and create something consistent out of it.
