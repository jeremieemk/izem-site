I was 19 when I first heard the fiery horns of Fela Kuti's "Lady" on my friend Nicolas' speakers in my neighbourhood of Paris. I went straight to one of the Virgin Megastore of Champs-Elysées (which doesn't exist anymore - and that's why I'm telling this story), took off a €3 price tag from a cheap item and stuck it on a Fela vinyl box set. This box set contained 6 albums including ITT. The guitar riff of this tune has been playing in my head since. This ITT remix was my contribution to Fela's 75th birthday celebration. Long live Fela!
