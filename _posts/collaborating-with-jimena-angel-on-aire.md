My friend Bertrand, co-founder of Parisian radio "Le Mellotron" and Elis Records, spent a lot of time in Colombia before the 2020 pandemic. Before his last trip to BogotÃ¡, we did some research on the Colombian music scene and we came across a beautiful song by Jimena Angel. Bertrand decided to get in touch with her during his trip.

When they met in BogotÃ¡, Bertrand offered Jimena to team up with Elis Records. She was up for it. Working with Jimena was easy from the start, even at a distance. We shared many influences, a common vision yet different perspectives and backgrounds. A perfect match.

The period we started working together was a shift in Jimena's life as she was leaving BogotÃ¡ for the Caribbean coast of Colombia. During the time we worked on her "Aire" EP, she was mainly based in Minca, although she moved house a few times during that process. I was almost as nomadic as Jimena during that period, spending a couple of months in the US and moving house in Lisbon every 2 or 3 months. It was the beginning on the 2020 pandemic. Instability and adversity sparkled creativity.

We worked on some of her existing material as well as new music she wrote during the remote collaboration. Many other musicians and producers got involved in this project : Berlin-based saxophonist and producer Ben Abarbanel-Wolff (Pat Thomas, Ebo Taylor, Guts), French keys wizard and broken beat producer Nikitch, the Lisbon-based Dutch musician Collignon (ex Skip & Die) as well as the Ecuadorian producer, Joaquin Cornejo. Jimena built herself a DIY recording booth with a mattress, a few sheets and a little help from her Minca neighboor. Everything was recorded remotely between Colombia, Lisboa, Quito, Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam.

The EP "Aire" was released on 16/10/2020. The singles "Llamameya" and "Tengo lo que tengo" gained a lot of airplay on some major national radios in France, Germany and Colombia. To be continued.
